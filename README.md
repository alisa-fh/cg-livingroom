# Computer Graphics Living Room Assignment
I have developed a living room by implementing webGL through javascript.

## How to run the living room

Because of security issues related to loading textures from a local system,
it is necessary to start a HTTP server on your machine.  
In terminal / command prompt, open the directory containing the source code files.  
Run the following command to install http-server:

```
npm install http-server
```
Then to start the server, run the following command in the correct directory.

```
http-server
```
A server will start on your machine, most likely at the :8080 port initially. The 
URL will be displayed in the terminal. Access this URL at your browser of choice and my living
room will be displayed!

## User interactions
One can interact with the living room in the following ways:  
**Left & right arrow keys:** Move around the living room  
**Up & down arrow keys:** Move the lamp up and down  
**x & z keys:** Moves chairs out and in respectively  
**c & v keys:** Closes and opens the table respectively
